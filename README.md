# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript projects repository! Here, I've created several projects to help me learn and practice JavaScript concepts. Below is a list of projects I've implemented:

## Project List:

1. **üé® Unlimited Colors:**
   - Description: This project allows users to generate random colors by clicking a button. It's a simple yet fun project to understand how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM and generate random values.


2. **üî¢ Guessing Number Game:**
   - Description: In this project, users can play a simple number guessing game. The game prompts the user to guess a number within a specified range and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
 

3. **‚è∞ Digital Clock:**
   - Description: A digital clock that displays the current time. It updates in real-time, providing users with a simple visual representation of the current time.


4. **üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Circle:**
   - Description: This project creates a circle that follows the mouse cursor's movements on the screen. It's a fun way to visualize mouse interactions using JavaScript and CSS.


5. **‚úèÔ∏è Text Editor:**
   - Description: Users can edit text and apply formatting options such as bold, italic, underline, uppercase, and lowercase. It's a simple text editor implemented using JavaScript.


6. **‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Checker:**
   - Description: This project detects and displays the keys pressed by the user on the keyboard. It's a useful tool for understanding keyboard events and handling user input.


7. **üñºÔ∏è Random Images Generator (Unsplash API):**
   - Description: Fetches random images from the Unsplash API and displays them on the webpage. It demonstrates how to interact with external APIs using JavaScript's fetch function.


8. **üê± Cat Images Generator (CatAPI.com):**
   - Description: Similar to the random images generator, this project fetches cat images from the CatAPI.com and displays them on the webpage. It's a fun way to showcase cat pictures!


9. **üìú Scroll Progress Indicator:**
   - Description: Displays a progress indicator as the user scrolls down the webpage. It's a useful UI element to indicate how much content has been scrolled through.


10. **‚úçÔ∏è Typist Library (Typing Effect Animation):**
    - Description: Implements a typing effect animation where text appears as if it's being typed out. It's a great way to add dynamic content to webpages.

11. **üòÄ Emoji Interaction:**
    - Description: Changes emojis when hovered over and turns them into grayscale when not hovered. It's a simple yet effective way to add interactivity to emojis.


12. **üÉè Jokes Generator (Using Promises and XMLHttpRequest):**
    - Description: Generates random jokes asynchronously using promises and XMLHttpRequest. It fetches jokes from an `chunk norris API` and displays them on the webpage.


13. **‚öæ Debounce input with Github API:**
    - This project implements the debounce concept to optimize API requests based on user input. As the user types into an input field, the application waits for a short delay before making a request to the `https://github.api.com` API. This approach reduces unnecessary API calls and enhances the user experience by ensuring that requests are made only after the user has finished typing.
